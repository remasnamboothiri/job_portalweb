# Dashboard Interview Links Fix - COMPLETED

## âœ… ISSUE RESOLVED

The interview links are now properly implemented and working in the jobseeker dashboard.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Dashboard View (views.py)**
- Fixed the `jobseeker_dashboard()` function to properly query interviews
- Added comprehensive error handling for different database schemas
- Added logging to track interview queries
- Changed ordering from `-interview_date` to `-created_at` to handle interviews without dates

### 2. **Dashboard Template**
- Completely restructured the template to show interviews prominently
- Added proper handling for interviews without dates (`{% if interview.interview_date %}`)
- Separated interview display from application display
- Added copyable interview links with JavaScript functionality

### 3. **Test Data Created**
- Created test users: `testcandidate` and `testrecruiter`
- Created test jobs: "Test Developer" and "Frontend Developer"  
- Created 2 test interviews for `testcandidate`

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

**Database contains:**
- 4 users (including testcandidate)
