# Job Portal Database Fix Summary

## Issue
The jobseeker dashboard was showing a database error:
```
django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: column jobapp_interview.uuid does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The Interview model had a `uuid` field defined in the Django model, but the database table on the production server (Render) didn't have this column, causing a schema mismatch.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Model Updates (`jobapp/models.py`)
- Added error handling in the `Interview.save()` method to gracefully handle missing uuid field
- Added `get_uuid` property that safely returns uuid or falls back to interview_id
- Updated field access to be more robust

### 2. View Updates (`jobapp/views.py`)
- Modified `jobseeker_dashboard()` to use `only()` to avoid selecting problematic fields
- Modified `recruiter_dashboard()` to use `only()` to avoid selecting problematic fields
- Updated interview lookup logic to try uuid first, then fall back to interview_id
- Added comprehensive error handling for interview retrieval

### 3. Template Updates (`templates/jobapp/jobseeker_dashboard.html`)
- Changed `interview.uuid` to `interview.get_uuid` for safe access
- Updated all interview URL generation to use the safe property

### 4. Database Migrations
- Created `0013_fix_interview_schema.py` to handle database schema issues
- Created `0014_ensure_interview_uuid.py` to ensure proper uuid field configuration
- Made migrations database-agnostic (works with both PostgreSQL and SQLite)

### 5. Management Commands
- Created `fix_interview_schema.py` management command for manual fixes
- Added deployment scripts for testing and validation

## Testing
All fixes have been tested locally and confirmed working:
- ✅ Database connection successful
- ✅ Interview model accessible
- ✅ Migrations run successfully
- ✅ Dashboard view returns 200 status
- ✅ No more uuid field errors

## Deployment
The fixes are backward compatible and should work on both development and production environments. The application will now:

1. Handle missing uuid fields gracefully
2. Fall back to interview_id when uuid is not available
3. Continue working even if database schema is not fully migrated
4. Provide better error handling and logging

## Files Modified
- `jobapp/models.py` - Interview model improvements
- `jobapp/views.py` - View error handling
- `templates/jobapp/jobseeker_dashboard.html` - Template safety
- `jobapp/migrations/0013_fix_interview_schema.py` - New migration
- `jobapp/migrations/0014_ensure_interview_uuid.py` - New migration
- Various test and deployment scripts

The jobseeker dashboard should now work correctly without the database error.
