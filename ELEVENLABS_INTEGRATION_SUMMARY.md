## ElevenLabs API Key Issue

The provided API key (`sk_4cf998593ac2999cc4d0424686da58baedc38df3edfb11ea`) has **limited permissions**:
- ‚ùå Missing `text_to_speech` permission
- ‚ùå Missing `user_read` permission

### To Enable ElevenLabs (Optional)
1. **Check your ElevenLabs account** at https://elevenlabs.io/
2. **Verify API key permissions** in your dashboard
3. **Ensure you have credits/subscription** for TTS
4. **Test the API key** using the provided test scripts

### When ElevenLabs is Working
Simply change this line in `jobapp/tts.py`:
```python
# Change from:
def generate_tts(text, model="female_professional", force_gtts=True, force_elevenlabs=False):

# To:
def generate_tts(text, model="female_professional", force_gtts=False, force_elevenlabs=True):
```
