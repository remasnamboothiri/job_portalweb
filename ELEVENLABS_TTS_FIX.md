# ElevenLabs TTS Fix - Female Voice Implementation

## Problem Fixed
The interview system was using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) which produces robotic male voice instead of the desired professional female voice for the AI interviewer.

## Solution Implemented
Switched to ElevenLabs API for high-quality female voice generation with gTTS as fallback.

## Files Modified

### 1. TTS System (`jobapp/tts.py`)
- **Changed**: Primary TTS service from gTTS to ElevenLabs
- **Added**: Two female voice options:
  - `female_professional`: Clean, professional female voice (default)
  - `female_friendly`: Warm, friendly female voice
- **Improved**: Fallback system (ElevenLabs â†’ gTTS if API fails)

### 2. Test Interface (`templates/jobapp/test_elevenlabs.html`)
- **Added**: Web interface to test ElevenLabs voices
- **Features**: 
  - Quick test buttons for both voice types
  - Custom text input with voice selection
  - System health check
  - Audio playback for testing

### 3. Views (`jobapp/views.py`)
- **Updated**: `test_tts` endpoint to support voice selection
- **Added**: Voice parameter support for testing different ElevenLabs voices

## How It Works

1. **Primary**: ElevenLabs API generates high-quality female voice
2. **Fallback**: If ElevenLabs fails, gTTS provides backup audio
3. **Caching**: Audio files are cached to improve performance
4. **Voice Options**: Two professional female voices available

## Testing

### Quick Test
Visit: `/test-elevenlabs/` to test the new voice system

### API Test
```bash
curl -X POST /test-tts/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello! Welcome to your interview.", "voice": "female_professional"}'
```

## Expected Results

- **Interview Voice**: Professional female voice instead of robotic male
- **Audio Quality**: High-quality, natural-sounding speech
- **Reliability**: Automatic fallback if ElevenLabs API is unavailable
- **Performance**: Cached audio files for faster loading

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your environment:
```
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Update Code**: Deploy the modified files
2. **Set API Key**: Add ElevenLabs API key to environment variables
3. **Test**: Visit `/test-elevenlabs/` to verify voice quality
4. **Monitor**: Check logs for "ElevenLabs TTS successful" messages

## Verification

After deployment, the interview system will:
- Use professional female voice for AI interviewer
- Automatically fallback to gTTS if needed
- Cache audio files for better performance
- Log which service is being used

The robotic male voice issue should be completely resolved with natural, professional female voice for all interview interactions.
