# Job Portal Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Resume Viewing Issue ("Not Found" Error)
**Problem**: When clicking "View Resume" button in the recruiter dashboard, users got a "Not Found" error for resume files.

**Root Cause**: Media files were not being served properly in production.

**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced the `serve_media` function in `views.py` with better error handling and logging
- Added explicit media file serving in production URLs configuration
- Added proper media URL patterns for production environment

**Files Modified**:
- `jobapp/views.py` - Enhanced `serve_media` function
- `job_platform/urls.py` - Added production media serving

### 2. Dropdown Issue (Database Error)
**Problem**: In the "Your Posted Jobs" section, clicking the dropdown arrow next to "Update Status" caused a database error: `Cannot resolve keyword 'job' into field`.

**Root Cause**: The `add_candidates` view was trying to filter `Candidate.objects.filter(job=job)` but the `Candidate` model doesn't have a `job` field.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed the `add_candidates` view to remove references to non-existent `job` field
- Updated candidate filtering to use `added_by` field instead
- Fixed the `update_job_status` function to handle status updates properly
- Cleaned up the recruiter dashboard to use proper Django ORM queries instead of raw SQL

**Files Modified**:
- `jobapp/views.py` - Fixed `add_candidates`, `update_job_status`, and `recruiter_dashboard` functions

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Understanding
The `Candidate` model has these fields:
- `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `resume`, `added_by`, `added_at`
- **No `job` field exists** - candidates are linked to recruiters, not specific jobs

### Media File Serving
- Added better logging to track media file access attempts
- Enhanced error handling for missing files
- Added production-specific media serving configuration

### Status Update Fix
- Fixed job status dropdown functionality
- Added proper validation for status choices
- Improved error handling and logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Resume Viewing**: Test clicking "View Resume" buttons in the recruiter dashboard
2. **Status Updates**: Test the dropdown functionality in "Your Posted Jobs" section
3. **Candidate Management**: Test adding candidates and viewing candidate lists
