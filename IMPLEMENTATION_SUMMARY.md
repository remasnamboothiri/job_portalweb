## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes
- Removed `job` field from Candidate model
- Added unique constraint on `(email, added_by)`
- Candidates are now recruiter-specific, not job-specific

### Form Logic
- ScheduleInterviewForm now filters candidates by recruiter
- Auto-populates candidate details from selected candidate
- Generates unique interview links using UUID

### Email System
- Uses Django's built-in email backend
- Generates full interview URLs with domain detection
- Handles both development and production environments
- Graceful error handling for email failures
