  - `summary`: TextField for interview summary
  - `recording_data`: TextField for JSON recording metadata
  - `recording_path`: CharField for file path
  - `recording_duration`: FloatField for duration in seconds

## Technical Implementation Details

### Recording Process Flow
1. **Initialization**: Camera and microphone access requested
2. **Recording Start**: MediaRecorder starts automatically after 2 seconds
3. **Data Collection**: Video/audio chunks collected every second
4. **Recording Stop**: Triggered when interview ends or manually stopped
5. **Processing**: Chunks combined into Blob with proper MIME type
6. **Upload**: FormData sent to Django backend via AJAX
7. **Storage**: File saved to `/media/interview_recordings/` directory
8. **Database**: Metadata stored in Interview model

### Camera Management
1. **Stream Initialization**: getUserMedia with optimal constraints
2. **Toggle Functionality**: Enable/disable video tracks
3. **Visual Feedback**: Button color changes based on state
4. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for common issues

### File Storage Structure
```
/media/
  /interview_recordings/
    interview_{uuid}_{timestamp}.webm
```

### Recording Metadata (JSON)
```json
{
  "recording_path": "interview_recordings/filename.webm",
  "duration": 1234.56,
  "file_size": 12345678,
  "recorded_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "filename": "interview_uuid_timestamp.webm"
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Features
- **MediaRecorder API**: Chrome 47+, Firefox 25+, Safari 14.1+
- **getUserMedia**: Chrome 53+, Firefox 36+, Safari 11+
- **WebM Format**: Primary format with MP4 fallback

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Multiple MIME type support (VP9 → VP8 → WebM → MP4)
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Error messages for permission issues

## Security Considerations

### CSRF Protection
- All AJAX requests include CSRF tokens
- Server-side validation of requests

### File Validation
- File size limits enforced
- MIME type validation
- Secure file naming with timestamps

### Access Control
- Recording only available during active interviews
- UUID-based interview identification
- User authentication required

## Performance Optimizations

### Recording Efficiency
- 1-second chunk collection for smooth recording
- Automatic cleanup of temporary data
- Efficient blob processing

### UI Responsiveness
- Non-blocking recording operations
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Testing and Debugging

### Debug Functions Available
```javascript
// Access via browser console
window.interviewRecording.getRecordingStatus()
window.interviewRecording.startRecording()
window.interviewRecording.stopRecording()
window.interviewRecording.toggleCamera()
```

### Console Logging
- Comprehensive logging for all operations
- Error tracking and debugging information
- Performance monitoring

## Deployment Notes

### Required Directories
- Ensure `/media/interview_recordings/` directory exists
- Proper write permissions for Django application

### Environment Variables
- No additional environment variables required
- Uses existing Django settings

### Migration Required
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. **Cloud Storage**: Integration with AWS S3 or similar services

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. **File Size Monitoring**: Track recording file sizes
2. **Storage Usage**: Monitor disk space usage
3. **Error Tracking**: Log recording failures
4. **Performance Metrics**: Track recording success rates
