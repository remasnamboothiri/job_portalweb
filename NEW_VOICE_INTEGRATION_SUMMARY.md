## Test Results

✅ **Voice Integration**: Successfully added to system  
✅ **System Recognition**: Voice appears in available voices list  
✅ **Fallback System**: Works correctly when ElevenLabs API is unavailable  
⚠️ **API Key**: Current key needs text-to-speech permissions for ElevenLabs  

## API Key Requirements

The ElevenLabs API key needs the following permissions:
- `text_to_speech` - Required for voice synthesis

**Note**: The system gracefully falls back to gTTS when ElevenLabs is unavailable, ensuring uninterrupted service.

## Files Modified

1. `jobapp/tts.py` - Added new voice configuration
2. `test_elevenlabs.py` - Enhanced testing capabilities  
3. `test_new_voice.py` - New dedicated test script

## Next Steps

1. **API Key**: Update ElevenLabs API key with proper permissions
2. **Testing**: Run production tests with valid API key
3. **Documentation**: Update user documentation if needed

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test the new voice
python test_new_voice.py

# Test all ElevenLabs functionality  
python test_elevenlabs.py

# Test in Django shell
python manage.py shell
>>> from jobapp.tts import generate_tts, ELEVENLABS_VOICES
>>> print(list(ELEVENLABS_VOICES.keys()))
>>> audio = generate_tts("Test", model="female_natural")
```
